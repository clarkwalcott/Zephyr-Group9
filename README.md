For the purpose of this project, please ignore the navbar at the top of the user login page.

A finished product with boards will not be available at this time as our attempts to connect the Zephyr boards to our ec2 instance were unsuccessful. A new release of apt should allow for easier cmake installation on ubuntu systems that will hopefully make Zephyr much simpler to install on those systems. We were, however, able to install Zephyr successfully on MacOS but ran into complications when trying to install the net tools that would allow us to connect to our user interface.

Use cases can be found in the folder useCases.
The final goal of the project is stated [here](final-target-system.md)=

Information on website design/developer instructions can be found [here](developer-instructions.md)

Code for the boards can be found in the folder zephyrCode.
To work with zephyr one should read [this](setupZephyrInstructions.md)
