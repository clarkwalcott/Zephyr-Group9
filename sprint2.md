# Sprint 2

## Feature Backlog


### Zephyr Teams
1. Provide a "README.md" file that provides a full set of instructions for installing and configuring a version of your system that implements at least one of your use cases. All three is great, but your teams are in different places.
	- The README.md can be found in our repo, named sprint2README.md 

2. Describe what board's or emulators your final product will use. Be specific. This will be a commitment at this point.
	- We will be using the DBOARD QEMU cortex_m3 board/emulator, for it allows printing to the command line which will be helpful for us. 

## General Design

1.	Clarify functional requirement specs for your use cases through conversations with stakeholders via Slack for Augur and Zephyr, and via Ed McCain for RJI> 
	- Our functional requirements haven't really changed from Sprint 1, and from watching the Slack channel we feel we are on the right path
	- We have implemented our Grandparent Use Case, but in terms of the other 2 Use Cases we don't know if our requirements need to change
		- These changes will be seen in Sprint 3 and onward, when implementation occurs
2.	Make any necessary changes to your ERD. Save this new ERD in GitHub and link it to the Sprint 2 wiki page.
	- Our ERD still fleshes out our project in a manner we agree with, so we didnt see it neccessary to make any changes

3.	Design Document below 
	- what is necessary for your whole system to work 
		â€“ Data Sources: data comes from the user and stored in the input variable, login data will also be stored on the EC2 instance 
		- Functions: main(), callHelp(), messageOthers(), notifyParents()
		- The rest of the inventory: DBOARD QEMU cortex_m3, project files, EC2 instance, and possibly a database in the future, but isnt needed at this point in time for sprint 2
	- Show clearly how the different software components communicate. 
		- the board allows for communication between the project build and the user
		- The EC2 instance provides a user friendly UI for the grandparent in this Use Case to access
		- the buttons on the website allows for communication to the user, visually showing them when something has happened
	- Document the reasons for your decisions where you have choices in design. 
		- At first the command line was our way of user interaction, but we felt it was a little too primitive for a grandparent
			- The user input was also giving us many errors, so a switch seemed mandatory
		- We have now switched to a EC2 instance/server to allow the users to see our project through a more "user friendly" lens
			- In sprint 3 we also plan on connecting a database to this server, to allow for storage of login information, etc.
	 
4.	Mock up a full visual design, even it its a pencil sketch, for all the ways users interact with your system.
	- here is the visual design of user inputing on the command line
