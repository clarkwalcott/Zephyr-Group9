## Final Target System

In the end our project is mostly an EC2 instance that houses both interface and functionality. We have connected a database to our EC2 that hold user information, and allows for users to login to the site. The login is what determines the functionaltiy they are given access to, such as only the parent/admin having the create user funcionality. From here each user will have buttons that either have functionality on the site, or sends alerts to our Zephyr OS. If a user calls for help, this information will be sent as a response to zephyr. Other functionality like messages will be sent to through the site, or through the connected database. At the end of the day, our final system consists of an EC2 instance, a SQL Database, and connection to Zephyr OS through the World Wide Web.
